Version 3.0.0 Release Notes


**** Windows Sublime Text 3 Users ****

Due to a bug in Package Control 2.0.0, Windows ST3 users will need to open the
Sublime Text console (ctrl+`) and execute the following Python to properly
upgrade. All other users may ignore this part of the message.

import urllib.request,os; pr='Preferences.sublime-settings'; ip='ignored_packages'; n='Package Control'; s=sublime.load_settings(pr); ig=s.get(ip); ig.append(n); s.set(ip,ig); sublime.save_settings('Preferences.sublime-settings'); pf=n+'.sublime-package'; urllib.request.install_opener(urllib.request.build_opener(urllib.request.ProxyHandler())); by=urllib.request.urlopen('https://packagecontrol.io/prerelease/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read(); open(os.path.join(sublime.installed_packages_path(),pf),'wb').write(by); ig.remove(n); s.set(ip,ig); sublime.save_settings(pr); print('Package Control upgrade successful!')

********


TLDR version: Almost two months of full-time development has added dependency
support, SSL for Linux, new Windows HTTP fallback, ST2 on Windows patches,
and general improved robustness to Package Control.


As of July 2014, I now work for myself. This has allowed me to spend more time
working on open source software, including Package Control. If you appreciate
the work I've done, please consider a small donation. If even 5% of regular
users donated the price of a coffee or beer, that would cover quite a bit of
my development time! See https://packagecontrol.io/about for options.


Some recent Package Control stats:

 + every weekday over 1M JSON requests his the channel server
 + in December, the channel server will transmit 4TB+ of compressed JSON data
 + users have installed, upgraded or removed 85M packages since late 2011


The following notes detail some of the bigger aspects of this new release.

Backwards Compatibility Breaks

 - For users who have a custom SSL CA certs, please note that any custom certs
   must now be stored in "Packages/User/Package Control.user-ca-bundle". This
   mechanism replaces the old "certs" setting. In general this should not be
   necessary since Package Control now utilizes OS certificate stores for CA
   certs.

Dependencies

 - Package Control now supports package dependencies for the sake of shipping
   non-user-facing binary files that are needed by packages. These will commonly
   include compiled Python modules and executables.

 - A package loader that is run before any other non-default packages. This adds
   dependency folders to sys.path and makes the "package_control" Python module
   always available, instead of waiting until Sublime Text loads up all 
   packages that are alphabetically before "Package Control".

Upgrades

 - Improved handling of package upgrades involving editor customizations.
   Theme, Color Scheme and Syntax upgrades will no longer cause Sublime Text
   error messages. If a package containing one of these is being upgraded,
   Package Control will change the setting back to the default just before
   starting. Once complete, the customized settings will be restored.

 - In-use file upgrades improved. Package Control performs extra steps on
   Windows to allow upgrades to occur for packages that use various binary
   files such as DLLs and executables.

 - A package event API was added to allow packages to know if they were just
   installed, are about to be upgraded, were just upgraded, or are about to be
   removed. See https://packagecontrol.io/docs for more details.

 - Package upgrades that are interupted by Sublime Text being closed or
   restarted will no longer result in packages being left in the
   "ignored_packages" list.

Commands

 - Additional commands were added to the command palette, including:

    + Advanced Install Package: install packages via a comma-separated list
    + List Unmanaged Packages: list packages not controlled via Package Control
    + Remove Channel: helper to remove a channel
    + Remove Repository: helper to remove a repository

Syncing

 - Package Control will now remove packages, upon start, that have been deleted
   from the "installed_packages" list. This improves the recommended
   configuration of just syncing the "Packages/User/" folder.

 - Incorrect syncing of packages will now be detected and users will be
   notified of the issue. Sync warnings will only be raised when a package for
   a specific platform or version of Sublime Text is copied to an incompatible
   location.

Python Patches

 - Upgraded SSL support for Sublime Text 2 on Windows. _ssl.pyd files are
   installed for ST2 on Windows that are compiled against the latest version
   of OpenSSL. This allows secure connections to validate modern SSL
   certificates that use SHA-2 signatures.

 - Package Control now patches the Python select module for Sublime Text 2 on
   Windows. This patch will make the select module available for use by
   all packages.

Security

 - All repositories and packages are now required to use SSL for improved
   security.

 - SSL support for Linux. Package Control now ships _ssl.so files that are
   compatible with OpenSSL 0.9.8 and 1.0.x (both libssl-1.0.0 and libssl-10).
   Thanks to the new package loader, these are injected before any other
   packages are loaded. Gone are the days of package developers having to
   bundle them individually, or using curl/wget.

 - SSL CA certificates are now 100% sourced from the OS. Previously Package
   Control included functionality to distribute SSL CA certificates to allow
   validation of SSL certs on OS X and Windows. With version 3.0.0, Package
   Control can now explort SSL CA certs from the Windows trust store into the
   format necessary for OpenSSL. This allows PC to no longer be responsible for
   distributing SSL CA certs in a secure way.

 - Added a parser that allows Package Control to validate SSL certificates using
   SubjectAltName fields for certs that are valid for multiple hostnames.
   Previously such certificates were only supported in Sublime Text 3.

HTTP

 - Urllib-based downloader for Windows. In version 2.0.0, Package Control
   switched from using urllib for downloads to using the WinINet API on Windows.
   This allowed PC to delegate all of the work of proxy auto-detection and SSL
   verification to the OS. Unfortunately some users are unable to connect to
   the internet using WinINet due to local policies. Other users experienced
   issues with SSL connectivity through the WinINet API. As of version 3.0.0,
   Package Control will automatically fall back to the urllib downloader if
   WinINet is unable to connect.

 - HTTP compression based on bzip2 is now used for the channel file to reduce
   bandwidth usage. Every Sublime Text install will now have the bz2 module
   available for use by other packages.

Repositories and Channels

 - A new schema_version of the channel and repository JSON files was released
   that supports using prefixed tags to allow for semantic versions with
   separate code-bases for different versions of Sublime Text. See
   https://github.com/wbond/package_control/blob/master/example-repository.json
   for details.

 - A new package, ChannelRepositoryTools, was released that provides commands
   for package developers to upgrade their older repository JSON files to the
   newest standard. https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ChannelRepositoryTools
   contains more information.

Package Creation

 - The "Create Binary Package File" command was removed, but replaced with
   the "package_profiles" setting which allows for any number of different
   package creation configurations. See Preferences > Package Settings >
   Package Control > Setting - Default for more details.
